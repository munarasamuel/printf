.SH NAME
.B _printf
- Formatted output conversion.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"


.B int _print(const char *
.I format
.B , ...)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf()
Prints to standard output under the control of a
.I format
string that specifieshow subsequent arguments are converted
for output.
.SH Return value
On successful return, these functions return the nmber of
characters printed, excluding the null byte used to end
output to strings.


If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SH Format of the format string
The format strings is composed of 0 or more directives
(ordinary characters that are not %), which are copied to the
output stream. The format string is also comosed of
conversion specifications, each of which result in fetching
zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion
specification, is introduced by the character % and ends with
the convesion specifier.
The argument must correspond properly with the conversion
specifier. By default, the arguments are used in the order
given.
.SH The conversion specifier
A character thatspecifies the type of conversion to be
applied. The conversions specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR c
The int arument is to an unsigned char, then the
resulting character is written
.TP
.B s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an
array of character type (pointerto a string). Chatacters
from the array are written up to a terminating null byte, but
do not include the terminating null byte.
.TP
.B S
Prints a string. Non printable characters are printed as "\x"
followed by their ASCII values in two digit hexadecimal
.TP
B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B x, X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned lowercase
hexadecimal notation(x), or unsigned uppercase hexadecimal
notation(X).
.TP
.B u
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned decimal
notation
.TP
.B o, b
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal
notation(o) or binary notation(b).
.TP
.B p
Address is printed in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B r
Prints a string in reverse.
.TP
.B R
Prints a string converted to rot13
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written but no argument is converted. The complete
version specification is '%%'
.SH EXAMPLE
To print the day of the year, where weekday and month are
pointers to strings and day and year are integers:

#include "main.h"

_printf("%s, %s %d, %d\\n", weekday, month, day, year);

.I printf(3)
.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
